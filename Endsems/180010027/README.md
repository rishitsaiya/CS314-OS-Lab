### README.txt - Rishit Saiya 180010027

I have used `include <bits/stdc++.h>` library in `master-worker.c`. So while compiling the code, the following command was used:

```
g++ master-worker.c -lpthread
```

#### Testing Phase:

The program needs 4 Command Line Arguments - 

```
./runme.sh 1000 800 12 10
```


<strong>Note:</strong> With the help of bits library, all the test cases are passed and Synchronization Primitives are correctly implemented.
